I would want to create a remote repository especially if I'm working as a team, 
and would like to share my code changes with others. 

I would only want to pull changes manually because I would like to control when
these changes are relevant to my project, and sometimes I don't want the changes
affecting my project. If Github syncs everytime with my remote, I might ahve trouble
with keeping up with the changes that I don't want.
