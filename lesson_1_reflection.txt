fc is convenient to quickly identify differences
and find the bug

if ever need to take an old version and use that for another project
having easy access to history helps

choosing logically when to save will make version control more effective
for the user 

saves time to pull out each individual file and compare 

git log pulls all the recent versions, git diff compares two versions and shows
the differences between the 2 - requires two IDs 

using version control, i'll be more confident to make changes knowing that i 
can return to previous versions to see if a bug occurs during those changes

not sure right now, but in the future will be useful for creating versions of projects
