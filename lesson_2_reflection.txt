You need to initialize a repository to start making commits and keeping track of the 
changes. When you initiatlize one, it does not make a initial commit for you, but
you can do the initial commit manually. 

staging area is a temporary place for potential commits, so it allows the user to
consider options and play around with files to commit before making the changes 
permanent.
