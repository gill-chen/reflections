You need to initialize a repository to start making commits and keeping track of the 
changes. When you initiatlize one, it does not make a initial commit for you, but
you can do the initial commit manually. 

staging area is a temporary place for potential commits, so it allows the user to
consider options and play around with files to commit before making the changes 
permanent. 

diagrams help visualize branch structure by showing you how commits are represented
in each branch and how they relate with each other

the result of merging two branches is a new master branch (if indeed merging to the 
master)in the diagram, it is represented by two branches connecting at the tip, 
with the tip being the new head


The pros of Git being able to merge automatically saves a lot of time making 
the changes from two brnahces comes together. When it can't merge, it helps
to manually change the conflict since it saves a lot of time, and logically
it makes sense to have the creator figure out what lines of code needs to be
retained, or changed.
